GeneralEccView_textHeader=This visual shows the general process of finding and correcting bit errors in data transmissions over a noisy channel using error-correcting codes. With larger linear codes like binary Goppa code ECC is used in the McEliece and Niederreiter crypto schemes to scramble a message (see McEliece tab)\n\n Below you can enter a message and click on the "next step" button to continue.
GeneralEccView_textInfo_step1=The input text is handled as an ASCII encoded bit set. 
GeneralEccView_textInfo_step2=The sender encodes the data according to the selected coding scheme. In this example Hamming code was used, which adds 3 parity check bits to every 4 bits of data. 
GeneralEccView_textInfo_step3=An error gets introduced in the data transmission. Here a single bit in each codeword is flipped (marked in red).
GeneralEccView_textInfo_step4=The receiving end checks for errors by calculating the error syndrome, which also identifies the position of the bit in error. The erroneous bits are detected and flipped to reproduce the correct codewords.
GeneralEccView_textInfo_step5=Lastly the string is decoded by extracting the data bits.

HammingCryptoView_textHeader=This view shows a simplified McEliece Cryptosystem with Hamming code. This is not secure due to the static codewords and only one correctable error per segment. In comparison Goppa code has randomnes due to the nature of irrreducible polynomal over a finite field and can correct multiple errors depending on the codeword length. On the other hand, the function of the algorithm can be easier understood with smaller matrices. Therefor we choose this approach to visualize the McEliece System.\n\nYou can enter any message and the key parameters at the first step or let the program fill them by clicking on "Generate key".

HammingCryptoView_step1=Enter key parameters or let the application fill in random values by clicking on "generate".
HammingCryptoView_step2=To encrypt the message, Bob performs the following steps:\n1. Bob encodes the message m as a binary string of length n.\n2. Bob computes the vector c' by multiplieing m with the public key G' = S*G*P\n3. Bob generates a random n-bit vector e containing exactly t errors, which is determined by the number of errors the code can correct (1 in this example).\n4. Bob computes the ciphertext as c = C' + e.
HammingCryptoView_step3=Upon receiving an encrypted message, Alice deciphers it by following these steps:\n1. Alice multiplies the ciphertext c' with the inverse of the permutation matrix P.\n2. Alice uses the decoding algorithm to correct the errors in c'.\n3. Alice recovers the original message by multyplying m' with the inverse of S.

McElieceView_textHeader=The McEliece cryptosystem is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that uses linear error correcting codes. Robert McEliece developed the original proposal in 1978 but it was not considered for mainstream cryptography until it was proposed as a candidate for the NIST "post-quantum cryptography standardization". The algorithms security is based on the hardness of decoding a general linear code.\n\nYou can enter values or let the program fill the data by clicking on "Generate key", then encrypt or decrypt the message.
