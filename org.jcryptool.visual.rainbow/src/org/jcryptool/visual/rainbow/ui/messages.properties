RainbowSignatureView_lblHeader=Multivariate cryptography - The Rainbow signature scheme
RainbowSignatureView_textInfoHead=This visualization represents the function of multivariate cryptography on the example of the Rainbow signature scheme. A message is signed by solving a linear equation system with multiple unknowns. In the case of Rainbow, there are several layers of multivariate LES, each layer using the coefficients of the layer above. Because of the NP-hardness of solving multivariate equation system it can not be computed in sub-exponential time and a special trapdoor is needed. The private key contains this trapdoor, a set of randomly chosen variables which solve the equation system, and information for constructing the LES. The result is the signature which can be verified by pluging it into the public key. The latter contains the whole equation system in modified (scrambled) form so one cannot derive information about the parameters of the private key .
